Teachers are one of the most important pillars of society – these individuals spend their entire lives enabling students to learn and explore. Furthermore, teachers also increase literacy rates in a country, thereby enabling opportunities and jobs that will help students secure their lives. Almost every country in the world dedicates a day to celebrate and honour teachers. In India, teacher’s day is celebrated on 5th September, while the World Teacher’s Day is celebrated on 5th October. However, various countries have their own specific dates for honouring teachers. Read on to explore the reason why we celebrate Teachers Day around the world.
Teachers Day is celebrated to honour teachers and celebrate their contribution to a particular field or the community in general. The idea of celebrating the profession of a teacher is not new, it can be traced back to the 19th Century. During those times, a local teacher’s contribution is celebrated or a specific achievement in education. This is one reason why the world celebrates Teachers Day on different dates. For instance, India celebrates Teacher’s Day on September 5, commemorating the birth of the second President of India, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. Most other countries celebrate World Teacher’s Day on October 5th, as established by UNESCO.
Guru Purnima is an Indian festival dedicated to honouring academic and spiritual teachers. It historically marks the birth of Ved Vyasa, the author of the Mahabharata, Vedas and the Puranas. The festival is traditionally celebrated by the Jains and Buddhists to honour teachers who enlighten others with no monetary expectation in return. It is traditionally celebrated during the full moon day of the Hindu calendar month of Ashada. This corresponds to June and July of the Gregorian calendar.

The birth of the Second President of India  Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, on September 5th,  is also celebrated as Teachers Day. When he became the President of India, some of his students and friends requested him to celebrate his birthday on 5th September. He had replied that he would be honoured if the contribution of all teachers would be observed on that particular day instead of celebrating his birthday. And ever since then, 5th September every year has been celebrated as Teacher’s day.
World Teachers Day, or International Teacher’s Day, is celebrated on October 5 every year. The date marks the commemoration when a special conference was held by UNESCO in Paris on 5th October 1966. The event set standards for the rights and responsibilities of teachers, their initial preparation, further education and learning conditions. World Teachers Day is generally observed by gifting the teachers a present and a thank-you card. Drawings, poems and quotes are also given as a sign of appreciation.
In India, teachers and students report to class as usual on Teacher’s Day. However, classes and lectures are replaced by celebrations and remembrances. Students and teachers also take part in many activities and mini-games. It is also common for students and their parents to present gifts to the teachers. Many students also organize plays and dance performances on this particular day.
Teachers Day is a very special occasion for a teacher and student. It is celebrated every year on 5 September to give respect and love to the teachers. 5th September is the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radahkrishan who was a great teacher and second president of India. Teachers are the main reason for the growth of the nation. They make the world a better place. Teachers do not only teach us subjects but they also help us grow by teaching us the moral values which are more important than studies. A good teacher is a candle that burns itself to light the way for others.

During 1962-67 when Dr. Radhakrishan was the president of India, people requested him to celebrate his birthday. He replied that instead of celebrating his birthday, he would be privileged if that day is celebrated as Teachers Day. From that day, India celebrated Teachers day every year on 5th September. On this day, students organize dance and singing competitions, games, and mimicry of their teachers. Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru once said that Dr. Radakrishan has served the country good but above all, he was a great teacher that everyone adored.

A teacher is the second parent for children. We want to thank the teachers for always guiding us and showing us the right way. You are an inspiration for all the children. We are lucky to have you as a guide. We are giving you our gratitude for giving us the knowledge.
Teachers are the backbone of every person’s life. It is the teacher that teaches students the new meaning of life. They show us the right path and stop us from doing anything wrong. They may see from the outside but they care for each student and wish for their growth. Do not forget that the student who does not respect their teachers, never grow in life. Teachers mold the student’s personality. They are the only selfless person that happily gives children all their knowledge.

Dr. Radhakrishan was a great teacher that everyone loved. He was born in a middle-class family on 5 September 1888. He completed college and become a professor at Madras Christian College. He became principal at Harris Manchester College and the Vice-Chancellor at Andhra University. He was also the first philosopher and vice president of India. He became the president of India from 1962 to 1967. He taught Ethics at Oxford University for almost 16 years. He believed that education does not come from only books. Obtaining knowledge is far from what is professional and academic.

Other great teachers in the world taught us many things. Aristotle’s life teaches us to be good learners and never stop learning. Gautama Buddha was born a prince but he left all the luxuries for the life of knowledge. Emma Willard who was a women’s rights activist teaches us to raise our voice against injustice and never be afraid of it. Savitribai Phule was a poet and an Indian Social Reformer. She taught us to treat everyone equally and with respect.

We cannot imagine our future without the teacher’s guidance. They burn themselves to make our future bright. On this day, let us remember all the great teachers of the world and learn something from them. We thank the teachers for being patient with every student and working on each student’s weakness. Without your guidance we are incomplete. Thank you for your support and love.
